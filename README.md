To whomever is reviewing this I wanted to note the following adjustments I made. 
- Firstly I made the title "Horiseon | Increase Business Visbility".
- I added an ID to the "search-engine-optimization" so when the href is clicked it will scroll you down to the correct section, just as the others do. 
- I adjusted some of the <div> elements to <section> elements and changed the bottom section to a <footer> rather then it being a "class" called footer, so it is easier to read the HTML.
- I tried adding some notes in certain areas to better describe different parts in the HTML.
- On the CSS style sheet I condensed as much as I could without hurting the integrity and workability of the webpage. 
- I was able to delete some elements and classes altogether from the style sheet. 
- I removed as many repetitions as possible and removed the element <p> from the style sheet, but added more descriptors to the <body> in regards to font-size and color.
